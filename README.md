# Random\_youtube

This is a simple and dumb script that creates a random youtube watch url and
checks whether the video exists. It's a silly attempt to the get a completely
random video from youtube.

## Requires

To use this you require youtube\_dl installed in your local machine. 

## Usage

Just run the script, it'll throw 10 random urls each second and download any
video that it finds. This is extemely unlikely, so keep your hopes down.

## FAQ

# There's already randomyoutube.net

I know.

# Why?

I don't know.
